## Overview
This project encompasses two basic geometrical functions which determine points with extreme positions given point accumulations lying in a right-handed two-dimensional coordinate system:

`getleftmostPoint()`: returns point lying leftmost in relation to all given points

`getrightmostPoint()`: returns point lying rightmost in relation to all given points
